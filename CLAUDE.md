## Research Overview

**Small Reasoner + Million-Context Memory Compiler**

The core idea: a small dense model cannot *directly understand* million-token
context any more than a human can hold a million words in working memory.
Instead, we build a **Context Compiler** that preprocesses long context into
structured, typed, verifiable memory states, and a **Small Reasoner** that
retrieves from those states selectively during inference.

### Pipeline: capture → keep → align → margin → decide

### Typed Memory Architecture

| Memory Type | What it stores | Latency | Capacity | Device |
|-------------|---------------|---------|----------|--------|
| **RetNet State** | Streaming recurrent state | O(1) | Fixed d²×L | GPU |
| **TokenCopyBuffer** | Raw token embeddings for exact recall | O(1) | K slots | GPU |
| **Snapshot** | Reasoning intermediates at milestones | O(1) | K snapshots | GPU |
| **Engram (hot)** | Frequently accessed static knowledge | O(1) hash | M slots | GPU |
| **Engram (cold)** | Full static knowledge base | O(1) hash + IO | Millions of slots | CPU/NVMe |
| **AttnRes** | Cross-layer depth residual | O(1) | Last N layers | GPU |

### Three Progressive Experiments

| Stage | Context | Content | Success Criterion |
|-------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Stage 1: 64K** | 64K synthetic context | 1-8 key facts scattered in noise | Verify capture/readout/margin chain works |
| **Stage 2: 256K** | 256K document + citations | Multi-paragraph with cross-references | Verify multi-hop retrieval and citation accuracy |
| **Stage 3: 1M** | 1M tokens, multi-hop reasoning | Nested definitions, chain-of-proof | Verify scalable memory compiler |

### Oracle-to-Learned Approach

For each mechanism, we follow this disciplined path:

1. **Oracle annotation**: manually mark which positions are "critical" in synthetic data
2. **Prove upper bound**: show that with oracle knowledge, the mechanism achieves perfect performance
3. **Train gate to approximate**: replace oracle with a learned gate, train to match oracle allocation
4. **Verify margin**: confirm the learned gate produces sufficient logit margin over baseline

### Architecture Constraints

- Dense architecture — no MoE, no sparse attention, no brute-force scaling
- RetNet provides O(1) recurrent inference baseline
- Every improvement must be structural — smarter mechanisms, not bigger models
- All mechanisms must have formal proof + empirical validation on synthetic tasks

### Research Phases

| Phase | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Mechanism Validation** | Verify each component independently on synthetic tasks | **COMPLETE** |
| **Phase 2: O(1) Recurrent Inference** | Constant-memory inference via recurrent mode | **COMPLETE** |
| **Phase 3: Context Compiler (64K)** | Build capture/readout/margin pipeline for 64K context | **CURRENT** |
| Phase 4: Multi-hop Memory (256K) | Document-level retrieval with cross-references | Planned |
| Phase 5: Million-Context (1M) | Full memory compiler at 1M token scale | Planned |
| Phase 6: Real Tasks | Transfer to real language modeling (TinyStories etc.) | Planned |

### Phase 1 Results (COMPLETE)

| Capability | Task | seq_len | eval_em | Steps |
|-----------|------|---------|---------|-------|
| Long-context recall | needle | 1024 | 1.000 | 400 |
| Static fact memory | alien_static | 64 | 1.000 | 400 |
| Recursive reasoning | XOR | 1024 | 1.000 | 600 |
| Single-step reasoning | xor_final | 128 | 1.000 | 200 |

Key finding: RetNet alone fails needle (eval_em=0.000). TokenCopyBuffer
provides the direct copy path that makes exact recall possible.

### Phase 2 Results (COMPLETE)

Recurrent mode matches parallel mode exactly:

| seq_len | Parallel eval_em | Recurrent eval_em | Max diff |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| 128 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.000 |
| 512 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.015 |
| 1024 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.000 |

Memory is O(d²×L + d×K) — constant regardless of sequence length.

### Additional Data Points

- **Sinusoidal PE**: converges slower than learned PE (0.906 vs 1.000 at step 600, seq_len=1024)
- **Positional keys**: critical for TokenCopyBuffer at seq_len > 256 (0.797→1.000)
- **abs() on residual_scale**: prevents sign reversal from AdamW weight decay

## Autonomous Research Loop

### Objective

**Primary metric**: `eval_exact_match` on synthetic tasks — higher is better.
**Secondary metric**: `eval_loss` — lower is better.

These are unambiguous. The agent never has to guess whether an experiment succeeded.

### The Loop (NEVER STOP)

```
FOREVER:
  1. HYPOTHESIZE — form a concrete, falsifiable hypothesis about the architecture
  2. IMPLEMENT — modify src/ or experiments/ to test the hypothesis
  3. TRAIN — run experiments/train_synthetic.py with fixed step budget
  4. EVALUATE — compare eval_exact_match and eval_loss against baseline
  5. DECIDE:
     - IMPROVED → keep changes, commit with results, proceed
     - NEUTRAL + SIMPLER → keep (simplification win), commit
     - NEUTRAL + MORE COMPLEX → discard, git checkout changed files
     - WORSE → discard, git checkout changed files
  6. DISCOVER — analyze failures, identify bugs or architectural weaknesses
  7. FIX — patch bugs, adjust hyperparameters, or redesign components
  8. PROVE — when a mechanism survives empirical testing, write or update
     a formal proof in docs/proofs/ that validates the design
  9. COMMIT & PUSH — git push every meaningful step for traceability
  10. REFLECT — update this file or docs/ with findings, then loop
```

### Experiment Protocol

1. **Fixed step budget**: default 200 steps per experiment run.
   This makes all experiments directly comparable regardless of what changed.
2. **Baseline**: before any change, run the current code to establish the baseline.
3. **Single change per experiment**: modify one thing at a time so causality is clear.
4. **Multiple tasks**: test across needle, xor, xor_final, alien, alien_static.
   A real improvement should hold across tasks, not just one.
5. **Seed discipline**: always use --seed 42 for reproducibility.
   Use --eval-seed 10042 for evaluation consistency.

### Simplicity Criterion

All else being equal, simpler is better:

- A small improvement that adds ugly complexity is **not** worth it.
- Removing something and getting equal or better results is a **simplification win** — always keep.
- A ~0 improvement with much simpler code? **Keep.**
- Adding 20 lines of hacky code for 0.001 eval_loss improvement? **Not worth it.**

### Crash & Failure Protocol

- **OOM / CUDA error**: reduce batch_size or seq_len, retry once. If still fails, discard.
- **NaN / Inf loss**: check gradient norms, reduce learning rate, check for log(0). Fix if trivial, discard if fundamental.
- **Test failure**: fix the bug, re-run. If the test was wrong, update the test.
- **Timeout**: if a single experiment exceeds 10 minutes, kill and treat as failure.

### Git Discipline

Every meaningful step gets a commit:

```
feat: add milestone snapshot readout with RMSNorm gating
fix: engram gate NaN on empty hash table lookup
refactor: extract retention decay init into separate method
test: add contract test for engram hash capacity bounds
proof: formalize gradient dominance of snapshot readout
experiment: needle-512 eval_em improved 0.72→0.89 with snapshots
docs: record decision to defer MoE to phase 2
```

**Push after each commit.** Non-essential files (results, logs, figures, checkpoints)
are gitignored and stay local.
